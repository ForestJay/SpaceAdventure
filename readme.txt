Changes from 4.1 to 4.2

The Win-32 version of space adventure name was made to the setup program to avoid problems on NT

The function calls for the hit wave were added to gameutil.cpp.

Changes from 4.0 to 4.1
=======================
The rc file was improperly included which prevented the setup from running on most machines.  The 
icon was added to the setup program.
